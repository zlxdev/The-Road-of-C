# Contributing to The Road of C

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this learning journey! 🚀

Since this repository is a personal study archive, my goal is **understanding**, not just "working code."

## 🤝 How Can You Help?
I am looking for contributions that:
1.  **Refactor:** Suggest cleaner, more efficient ways to write low-level C.
2.  **Explain:** If you see a comment that is wrong or confusing, please correct it.
3.  **Optimize:** Point out memory leaks or unsafe pointer usage.

## 🚫 The AI Policy
Please **do not** simply copy-paste solutions from ChatGPT/Copilot without explanation.
*  **Allowed:** Using AI to explain a concept, then writing the code yourself.
*  **Not Allowed:** Submitting a PR entirely generated by AI that you cannot explain.

## 🛠️ Style Guide
* **Indentation:** 4 Spaces (or match the existing file).
* **Comments:** Please comment *why* you made a change, not just *what* the code does.
* **Variable Names:** Use descriptive names (e.g., `buffer_size` instead of `bs`).

## 📥 How to Submit Changes
1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Create a branch for your fix (`git checkout -b fix/memory-leak`).
3.  Commit your changes.
4.  Push to the branch.
5.  Open a **Pull Request** and describe what you learned or fixed.
