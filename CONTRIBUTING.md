# Contributing to The Road of C

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this learning journey!

Since this repository is a personal study archive, my goal is **understanding**, not just "working code."

##  How Can You Help?
I am looking for contributions that:
1.  **Refactor:** Suggest cleaner, more efficient ways to write low-level C.
2.  **Explain:** If you see a comment that is wrong or confusing, please correct it.
3.  **Optimize:** Point out memory leaks or unsafe pointer usage.

##  The AI Policy
Please **do not** simply copy-paste solutions from ChatGPT/Copilot without explanation.
*  **Allowed:** Using AI to explain a concept, then writing the code yourself.
*  **Not Allowed:** Submitting a PR entirely generated by AI that you cannot explain.

##  Style Guide
* **Indentation:** 4 Spaces (or match the existing file).
* **Comments:** Please comment *why* you made a change, not just *what* the code does.
* **Variable Names:** Use descriptive names (e.g., `buffer_size` instead of `bs`).

##  How to Submit Changes
1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Create a branch for your fix (`git checkout -b fix/memory-leak`).
3.  Commit your changes.
4.  Push to the branch.
5.  Open a **Pull Request** and describe what you learned or fixed.

If you are new to open source, here is the standard workflow to safely contribute code:

### 1. Fork the Project
Click the **Fork** button at the top-right of this page. This creates a copy of my code in *your* GitHub account.

### 2. Clone to your Machine
Open your terminal/WSL and run:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/The-Road-of-C.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/The-Road-of-C.git)
cd The-Road-of-C
```

### 3. Create a Branch (Important!)
Never work directly on `main`. Create a "branch" for your specific change:
```bash
# Example: If you are fixing a typo in pointers
git checkout -b fix/pointer-typo
```

### 4. Make your Changes
Edit the files in VS Code. When you are done:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix typo in pointer explanation"
```

### 5. Push and PR
Upload your branch to your fork:
```bash
git push origin fix/pointer-typo
```
Go back to GitHub, and you will see a green button says **"Compare & pull request"**. Click it!
