# The Road of C 🚀

Welcome to my personal archive for mastering the C programming language. This repository documents my journey from high-level understanding down to low-level memory management and hardware interaction.

> **Current Status:** Focusing on "small bits" and foundational concepts.

## Structured C Sources

### 💡 Philosophy: "Learn First, AI Later"
This repository is built with a specific mindset: **Hand-coded mastery.**
* **The Code:** Written primarily by hand to ensure deep understanding of syntax and logic.
* **AI Usage:** AI is treated as a *last resort*. It is used only when you are completely stuck on a concept, acting as a tutor rather than a writer. The goal is to struggle with the problem first, as that is where the learning happens.

### 📂 Repository Structure
Currently, some directories (like *University*, *Labs*, and *Projects*) are maintained locally or are Work-In-Progress (WIP) and may not be fully visible here yet.

* **Concepts/** - Core C mechanics (Pointers, Structs, Memory).
* **Labs/** - *[Hidden/Local]* Experimental code.
* **Projects/** - *[Hidden/Local]* Larger applications.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C (C99/C11)
* **Build System:** Make
* **Environment:** WSL / Linux

### ⚡ How to Run?
This project uses a custom `Makefile` system. To compile and run a specific file, use the following pattern in your terminal:

```bash
make <DIRECTORY>/<SUB_DIRECTORY>/<FILENAME>.run
```

### 🎯 Goals
* **Solidify knowledge of C fundamentals.**
* **Understand manual memory management.**
* **Help you guide to build a strong portfolio of low-level coding challenges.**

### 👥 Who is it intended to?

> Students who want to follow along with this repository, learn C from someone on the same path, or peers who are curious and want to master C before moving on to other languages.

### How is it different from other tutorials of C?

> Unlike standard tutorials, this is a student-led journey. Since the code is hand-written with minimal AI assistance, I invite contributors to suggest better coding styles, optimizations, or fixes. This repository prioritizes engagement and mutual learning over passive following.
